// The top k elements pattern is an important technique in coding that helps us efficiently find a specific number of elements, known as k, from a set of data.
// This is particularly useful when weâ€™re tasked with identifying the largest, smallest, or most/least frequent elements within an unsorted collection.
// Which data structure can we use to solve such problems? A heap is the best data structure to keep track of the smallest or largest k elements.
// With this pattern, we either use a max heap or a min heap to find the smallest or largest k elements, respectively, because they allow us to efficiently
// maintain a collection of elements ordered in a way that gives us quick access to the smallest (min heap) or largest (max heap) element.
// Use this pattern when these conditions are fulfilled:
// - Unsorted list analysis: We need to extract a specific subset of elements based on their size (largest or smallest), frequency (most or least frequent),
//   or other similar criteria from an unsorted list. This may be the requirement of the final solution, or it may be necessary as an intermediate step toward the final solution.
// - Identifying a specific subset: The goal is to identify a subset rather than just a single extreme value.
//   When phrases like top k, kth largest/smallest, k most frequent, k closest, or k highest/lowest describe our task,
//   it suggests the top k elements pattern is ideal for efficiently identifying a specific subset.
// Don't use this pattern if any of these conditions is fulfilled:
// - Presorted input: The input data is already sorted according to the criteria relevant to solving the problem.
// - Single extreme value: If only 1 extreme value (either the maximum or minimum) is required, that is, k=1,
//   as that problem can be solved in O(n) with a simple linear scan through the input data.
