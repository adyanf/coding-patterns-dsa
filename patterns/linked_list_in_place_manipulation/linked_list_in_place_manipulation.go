// The in-place manipulation of a linked list pattern allows us to modify a linked list without using any additional memory.
// In-place refers to an algorithm that processes or modifies a data structure using only the existing memory space,
// without requiring additional memory proportional to the input size.
// This pattern is best suited for problems where we need to modify the structure of the linked list, i.e., the order in which nodes are linked together.
// How can we implement the in-place reversal of nodes so that no extra space is used?
// We iterate over the linked list while keeping track of three nodes: the current node, the next node, and the previous node.
// Keeping track of these three nodes enables us to efficiently reverse the links between every pair of nodes.
// This in-place reversal of a linked list works in O(n) time and consumes only O(1) space.
// Use this pattern when these conditions are fulfilled:
// - Linked list restructuring: The input data is given as a linked list, and the task is to modify its structure without modifying the data of the individual nodes.
// - In-place modification: The modifications to the linked list must be made in place, that is, weâ€™re not allowed to use more than O(1) additional space.
